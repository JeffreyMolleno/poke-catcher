## Game Premise

This game is going to be very simple. The user will be able to select a
**Region**, **Location**, and **Area** they want to explore for Pokemon.

Once a user has selected the those three things, they should then be able to
click a button to **Explore** the selected **Area** for Pokemon.

Every **Area** has list of possible Pokemon that can be encountered there. A
random Pokemon from the currently selected area should be presented to the user
as an **Encounter**.
